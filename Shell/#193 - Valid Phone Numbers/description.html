Given a text file
<kbd>file.txt</kbd> that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.
<p>
    You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: <kbd>(xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx</kbd>. (<kbd>x</kbd>
    means a digit)
<p>
    You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
<p>
    Assume that <var>file.txt</var> has the following content:
<pre>
    987-123-4567
    123 456 7890
    (123) 456-7890
</pre>
Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:
<p>
<pre>
    987-123-4567
    (123) 456-7890
</pre>
