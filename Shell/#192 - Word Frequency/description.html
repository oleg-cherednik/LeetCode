Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file <kbd>words.txt</kbd>.
<p>
<ul>
    For simplicity sake, you may assume:
    <li><kbd>words.txt</kbd> contains only lowercase characters and space <kbd>' '</kbd> characters.</li>
    <li>Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.</li>
    <li>Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>

    Assume that <kbd>words.txt</kbd> has the following content:
<pre>
    the day is sunny the the
    the sunny is is
</pre>
Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
<pre>
    the 4
    is 3
    sunny 2
    day 1
</pre>
<ul>
    <b>Note:</b>
    <li>Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.</li>
    <li>Could you write it in one-line using <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-4.html">Unix pipes?</a></li>
</ul>
