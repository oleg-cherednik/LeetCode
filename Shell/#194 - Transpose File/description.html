Given a text file <kbd>file.txt</kbd>, transpose its content.
<p>
    You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the <kbd>' '</kbd> character.
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
<p>
    If <kbd>file.txt</kbd> has the following content:
<pre>
    name age
    alice 21
    ryan 30
</pre>
Output the following:
<p>
<pre>
    name alice ryan
    age 21 30
</pre>
