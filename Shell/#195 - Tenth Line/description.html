Given a text file <kbd>file.txt</kbd>, print just the 10th line of the file.
<p>
    <b>Example:</b>
<p>
    Assume that <kbd>file.txt</kbd> has the following content:
<pre>
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    Line 4
    Line 5
    Line 6
    Line 7
    Line 8
    Line 9
    Line 10
</pre>
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
<pre>
    Line 10
</pre>
<ol>
    <b>Note:</b>
    <li>If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?</li>
    <li>2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.</li>
</ol>
